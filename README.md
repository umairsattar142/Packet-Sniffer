## Packet-Sniffer| Introduction
This project implements a packet sniffer, which is a tool used in computer networks to capture and analyze network packets. The graphical user interface allows the user to specify the network interface from which packets will be captured. When the "Start Sniffing" button is clicked, the code uses Pyshark, a Python library for packet sniffing, to capture packets from the specified interface.

The captured packets are then displayed in a scrolling text area, allowing the user to view the packet details. Additionally, the "Save Packets" button enables the user to save the captured packets to a file for further analysis or archival purposes.Clear button is use to clear the packets which are displayed.

Overall, this [project provides a simple interface to perform packet sniffing tasks, such as monitoring network traffic, analyzing packet contents, and saving captured packets for later reference or analysis in computer networks.
